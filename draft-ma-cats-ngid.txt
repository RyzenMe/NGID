Abstract

   This document proposes a novel network address encoding scheme,
   called Network Geoidentifier (NGID), which aims to improve the
   efficiency and accuracy of network device management by directly
   embedding geolocation information (latitude and longitude) into IPv6
   and IPv4 addresses.

   This approach provides a native support for the geolocation of
   network devices and is expected to have a significant impact on the
   future of network management and service positioning.

1.  Introduction

   With the rapid growth of Internet devices, the traditional IP address
   system has shown its limitations in efficiently managing and
   identifying the physical location of devices.

   The NGID scheme proposed in this draft aims to solve this problem by
   directly encoding geolocation information in IPv6 and IPv4 addresses,
   so as to improve the management efficiency of network resources and
   optimize the geolocation of services.

2.  The Definition of Terms

   NGID: Network geographic identification code, a new type of network
   address coding scheme.

   Latitude: North or south latitude, measured from the equator to the
   north or south.

   Longitude: East or west longitude, the angle measured from the prime
   meridian to east or west.

3.  Design of NGID

   This section describes in detail the encoding scheme for NGID,
   including its implementation in the IPv6 and IPv4 address schemes.

3.1.  8-bit NGID

   1st place: North and south latitude identifiers (0 for north
   latitude, 1 for south latitude).

   Digits 2-4: Latitude position (binary encoding, can represent the
   range from 0 to 15, roughly representing latitude information)

   5th place: East and West longitude identification (0 for east
   longitude, 1 for west longitude).

   Bits 6-8: Longitude position (binary encoded, can represent the
   interval from 0 to 15, roughly represent longitude information)

3.2.  12-bit NGID

   1st place: North and south latitude identifiers (0 for north
   latitude, 1 for south latitude).

   Bits 2-6: Latitude position (binary encoded, which can represent a
   range from 0 to 31, providing better latitude accuracy than an 8-bit
   scheme)

   7th place: East and West longitude identification (0 for east
   longitude, 1 for west longitude).

   Bits 8-12: Longitude position (binary encoded, which can represent a
   range from 0 to 31, providing better longitude accuracy than the
   8-bit scheme)

3.3.  16-bit NGID

   1st place: North and south latitude identifiers (0 for north
   latitude, 1 for south latitude).

   Digits 2-8: Latitude position (binary encoded to represent the range
   from 0 to 127, which significantly improves the accuracy of latitude
   representation)

   9th place: East and West longitude identification (0 represents east
   longitude, 1 represents west longitude).

   Digits 10-16: Longitude position (binary encoded to represent the
   range from 0 to 127, significantly improving the accuracy of
   longitude representation)

3.4.  24-bit NGID

   1st place: North and south latitude identifiers (0 for north
   latitude, 1 for south latitude).

   Digits 2-12: Latitude position (can represent latitude information
   from 0 to 4095 with an accuracy of 90/4095 degrees)

   13th place: East and West longitude identification (0 for east
   longitude, 1 for west longitude).

   Digits 14-24: Longitude position (can represent longitude information
   from 0 to 4095 with an accuracy of 180/4095 degrees)

3.5.  32-bit NGID

   1st place: North and south latitude identifiers (0 for north
   latitude, 1 for south latitude).

   Digits 2-16: Latitude position (can represent latitude information
   from 0 to 32767 with an accuracy of 90/32767 degrees)

   17th place: East and West longitude identification (0 for east
   longitude, 1 for west longitude).

   Digits 18-32: Longitude position (can represent longitude information
   from 0 to 32767 with an accuracy of 180/32767 degrees)

4.  Encoding and decoding process

4.1.  NGID encoding steps

   Determine latitude and longitude: Get the actual latitude and
   longitude information of the device.

   Convert to Binary: Converts latitude and longitude values to binary
   format.

   The latitude is from 0 to 90 degrees from north to south, and the
   longitude from 0 to 180 degrees from east to west.

   Set the north-south latitude marker: set the first digit to 0 if it
   is north latitude, and set it to 1 if it is south latitude.

   Set Latitude Position: Padding the binary value of latitude to bits
   2-16.

   Set the east-west longitude marker: set the 17th bit to 0 if it is
   east longitude, and set it to 1 if it is west longitude.

   Set longitude position: Padding the binary value of longitude to bits
   18-32.

   Combined NGID: Combines the above binary bits into a 32-bit NGID.

   The geographical location is N 37.7749° and the longitude is W
   122.4194° North and South Latitude Identification: Since the latitude
   is north latitude (N), the first digit is set to 0.

   Latitude position: The latitude range is 0° to 90°.This range needs
   to be mapped into 15 bits.

   To simplify the process, the latitude value can be multiplied by a
   factor that allows it to be represented between 0 and 32767 (2^15 -
   1).

   Specifically, multiply by (2^15 - 1)/90.

   For 37.7749°, the corresponding coded value is (37.7749 * (32767 /
   90)).

   East-West Longitude Mark: Because the longitude is West Longitude
   (W), the 17th position is set to 1.

   Longitude position: Longitude ranges from 0° to 180°.

   Similar to latitude, this range needs to be mapped into 15 bits.

   Multiply by the factor (2^15 - 1)/180.

   For 122.4194°, the corresponding coded value is (122.4194 *
   (32767/180)).

4.2.  NGID decoding steps

   Extract the north-south latitude marker: Check the first position to
   determine whether it is north or south.

   Extract latitude position: Read the binary values of bits 2-16 and
   convert them to decimal latitude values.

   Extract the East and West meridian markers: Check the 17th position
   to determine whether it is east or west longitude.

   Extract longitude position: Read the binary value of bits 18-32 and
   convert it to a decimal longitude value.

   Convert to latitude and longitude: Converts the extracted latitude
   and longitude values to the actual latitude and longitude
   information.

   North and South Latitude Markers: Look at the 1st position, if it is
   0, it is the north latitude, if it is 1, it is the south latitude.

   Latitude Position: Extracts the values of bits 2-16 and converts them
   back to the original latitude.

   Assuming the extracted value is X, the original latitude is X /
   (32767 / 90).

   East-West Longitude Mark: Look at the 17th position, if it is 0, it
   is east longitude, if it is 1, it is west longitude.

   Longitude Position: Extract the values of the 18th-32nd digits and
   convert them back to the original longitude.

   Assuming the extracted value is Y, the original longitude is Y /
   (32767 / 180).

5.  Implementation considerations

   *  The address space remains the same: The NGID design uses only a
      subset of bits in the IP address to encode geolocation information
      without changing the total length of the address.

   This means that existing network equipment and software can continue
   to use these addresses without any modifications.

   *  No need to modify existing protocols: Geolocation information is
      encoded within the existing address structure and does not require
      the introduction of new protocols or modifications to existing
      network protocol stacks.

   *  Backwards compatible: Newly designed addresses can be recognized
      and processed by legacy network devices that do not support NGI
      because these devices ignore specific bits used to encode
      geolocation.

   *  Transparency: For applications and services that do not require
      geolocation information, the newly designed address is no
      different from a normal IP address and can be used transparently.

   *  Optional: NGIDs are optional features that network administrators
      can choose to enable in the appropriate network environment
      without affecting other parts of the network that do not use these
      features.

   *  Simple address resolution: Geo-coding is simple and intuitive,
      making it easy to implement address resolution in existing systems
      without the need for complex conversion or mapping processes.

   *  Maintain network hierarchy: The design of the NGID takes into
      account the hierarchy of the existing network, ensuring that the
      assignment and management of addresses still follows the existing
      network architecture and policies.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Security Risks

   *  Location tracking: If an attacker is able to access an NGID, they
      may track the physical location of the device, causing a breach of
      the user's privacy.

   *  Address mapping: By analyzing NGIDs, an attacker could construct
      an accurate map of the device's location, which could be used for
      inappropriate purposes, such as targeted attacks.

   *  Traffic analysis: Attackers may use geolocation information to
      analyze network traffic patterns to infer sensitive information.

   *  Identity association: If an NGID is associated with a specific
      person or organization, an attacker may use this information to
      build a profile of a user's behavior.

6.2.  Response

   *  Encryption: Encrypt NGIDs to ensure that only authorized network
      entities can parse and use this information.

   *  Anonymization: Use a mechanism to change the NGID periodically to
      prevent long-term tracking.

   *  Access control: Restrict access to NGIDs to ensure that only
      trusted network nodes can access this information.

   *  Network isolation: Establish logical or physical isolation between
      network devices that process NGIDs and other network devices to
      reduce the risk of leakage.

   *  Monitoring & Auditing: Implement monitoring systems to detect and
      record access to NGIDs for tracking and responding to security
      incidents as they occur.

   *  Laws and Policies: Formulate relevant laws and policies to
      regulate the use of NGID and protect user privacy.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There is no need for IANA to make new digital resource allocations
   and related management issues.
